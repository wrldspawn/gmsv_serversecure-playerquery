# gmsv_serversecure (+ A2S_PLAYER modification hook)

[![Build Status](https://metamann.visualstudio.com/GitHub%20danielga/_apis/build/status/danielga.gmsv_serversecure?branchName=master)](https://metamann.visualstudio.com/GitHub%20danielga/_build/latest?definitionId=7&branchName=master)

A module for Garry's Mod that mitigates exploits on the Source engine. Also includes `A2S_PLAYER` hook from gmsv_query.

Based on these plugins from AzuiSleet:

[serverplugin_serversecure][1]

[serverplugin_serversecure2][2]

[serversecure3][3]

## Compiling

The only supported compilation platform for this project on Windows is **Visual Studio 2017** on **release** mode. However, it's possible it'll work with *Visual Studio 2015*, *Visual Studio 2019* and *Visual Studio 2022* because of the unified runtime.

On Linux, everything should work fine as is, on **release** mode.

For macOS, any **Xcode (using the GCC compiler)** version *MIGHT* work as long as the **Mac OSX 10.7 SDK** is used, on **release** mode.

These restrictions are not random; they exist because of ABI compatibility reasons.

If stuff starts erroring or fails to work, be sure to check the correct line endings (`\n` and such) are present in the files for each OS.

## Requirements

This project requires [garrysmod_common][4], a framework to facilitate the creation of compilations files (Visual Studio, make, XCode, etc). Simply set the environment variable '**GARRYSMOD_COMMON**' or the premake option '**gmcommon**' to the path of your local copy of [garrysmod_common][4].

We also use [SourceSDK2013][5]. The links to [SourceSDK2013][5] point to my own fork of VALVe's repo and for good reason: Garry's Mod has lots of backwards incompatible changes to interfaces and it's much smaller, being perfect for automated build systems like Azure Pipelines (which is used for this project).
